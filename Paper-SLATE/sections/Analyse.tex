There is a lack of refactoring tools for dynamic languages and none of the existent ones cares about unexperienced users that are starting to program. 
And there are some dynamic languages such as Scheme, Racket and Python that are used to teach unexperienced programmers how to program.
Without a refactoring tool that helps those users in the refactoring operations delays the contact of the users with a refactoring tool and that might influence the low use of the refactoring tools.

Racket is a dynamic language that is known of being used as an introductory programming course in schools around the world. 
Racket also has an IDE, DrRacket that is a pedagogic environment \cite{drscheme_pegadogy} and it also supports development and extension of other programming languages \cite{tobin2011languages} and recently it has an implementation of python \cite{ramos2014implementation}.
Besides that, DrRacket only has one refactoring operation, that is the rename.
A refactoring tool that would suit an unexperienced programmer who is learning how to program is needed. 
That will motivate the unexperienced programmers to start using tool assisted refactoring operations and DrRacket seams to be the ideal candidate to have that refactoring tool.
