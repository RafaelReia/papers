Conclusion

"Why are you bothering me? what is your problem?"
We have refactoring tools for static typified languages whereas for dynamic typified languages there are very few and with few refactoring operations



"But are the dynamic languages important? why in hell should I care about that?"

Dynamic typified languages are often used by unexperienced users and are the language that is thought in introductory courses around the world.

"Well, if this languages are so useful, why there is few refactoring tools with also few refactoring operations?"
Main problem lack of type's information.

"How do you expect to solve this? "

"What are you going to do? what are the characteristics?"

"What already was done?"

"Is this going be evaluated? how? why?"

"What will be done in the near future?"
