\section{Conclusions}

%refactoring is used a lot
%BUT tools are underused.
% lack of dynamic refactoring tools and operations when compared with static object oriented ones. some of that exist are dead.
% Intention of creating a tool for unexperienced users to start doing refactoring operations with the tool.


Refactoring operations are important in order to maintain the quality of the software but because they are error prone and time consuming, refactoring tools are needed.
The objective of this overview is to show what exists regarding refactoring tools for dynamic languages and the difference between those tools and tools made for static object oriented languages.

%Although almost every tool made for static object oriented languages has the refactoring operations for 90\% of the refactoring operations used by the users, but in the best case scenario only 27\% of the refactoring operations were tool assisted.

Although almost every tool made for static languages supports 90\% of the refactoring operations, the users only use refactoring tools for 27\% of the cases. %showing that the major part of the refactoring operations are done manually]

This survey also shows how few refactoring operations exist in general for dynamic languages and why it is more difficult to make a refactoring tool for dynamic languages.

In conclusion, this paper shows the importance of having a refactoring tool concerned about the unexperienced users. 
Besides having dynamic languages as the recommended languages to learn how to program, the dynamic languages are growing. 
And that tool might help the users start to use the refactoring tools and refactoring their programs alongside with programming.

%and to show the need of a refactoring tool for dynamic languages targeted for unexperienced programmers
