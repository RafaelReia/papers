The support given to beginner programmers is increasing as the importance
of programming as a skill is increasing, even in areas non related with software development.
There are languages known to be suited for beginners and already exist
several pedagogical aware IDEs.
One important feature of an IDE is the refactoring tool, which allow the users to
safely improve their program quality.
However, there is till no refactoring tool concerned with beginner programmers.

In this paper, we present a refactoring tool for beginner programmers which we
implemented in the DrRacket, a simple but pedagogical IDE.
Our tool provides simple refactoring operations for the typical mistakes made
by beginners.
