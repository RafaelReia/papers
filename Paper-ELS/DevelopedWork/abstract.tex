The support given to beginner programmers is growing,
there are several languages to be adequate for beginners and there are already
several pedagogical aware IDEs.
One important feature of an IDE is the refactoring tool, which allow the users to
safely improve their program quality.
However, there is still no refactoring tool concerned with beginner programmers.

In this paper, we present a refactoring tool designed for beginner programmers which we
implemented in the DrRacket, a simple but pedagogical IDE.
Our tool provides simple refactoring operations for the typical mistakes made
by beginners.
