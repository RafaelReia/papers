The need to create better support tools rises with the growing importance
of programming as a skill among areas non related with software development.
One important tool of an IDE is the refactoring tool which allow the users to
safely improve their program quality.

Racket, a descendant of Scheme is widely used in introductory courses for
teaching computer science.
Racket has an IDE, DrRacket which is a simple and pedagogic IDE that do not have
refactoring operations besides the rename.

In this paper, we present a refactoring tool for beginner programmers in DrRacket.
Which provides simple refactoring operations for the typical errors made
by beginners.
And it also provide an automatic detection of possible refactoring operations
showing which refactoring operations could be applied.
