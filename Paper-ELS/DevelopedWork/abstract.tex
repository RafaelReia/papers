Typically, beginner programmers do not master the style rules of the
programming language they are using and, frequently, do not have yet
the logical agility to avoid writing redundant code.  As a result,
although their programs might be correct, they can also be improved
and it is important for the programmer to learn about the
improvements that, without changing the meaning of the program,
simplify it or transform it according to the style rules of the
language.  These kinds of transformations are the realm of
refactoring tools.  However, these tools are typically associated
with sophisticated integrated development environments (IDEs) that
are excessively complex for beginners.

In this paper, we present a refactoring tool designed for beginner
programmers, which we made available in DrRacket, a simple and
pedagogical IDE.  Our tool provides simple refactoring operations
for the typical mistakes made by beginners.
