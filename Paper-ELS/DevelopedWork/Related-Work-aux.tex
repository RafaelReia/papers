%%%%%% Writing Part of the Refactoring/refactoring rule
\section{Writting}
%FIXME is this important? does this require an introduction
\subsection{Syntax-Parse}

The Syntax-Parse function provided by Racket is rather useful for the refactoring
operations regarding mainly syntax information.
It has a wide range of options to help matching the correct syntax it also have  %fine tunning
backtracking.
With Backtracking it is possible to have several rules to be matched
in the same syntax parser which helps to create more sophisticated rules.

\subsubsection{Literal vs Datum-literal}
One of the options in the syntax-parse is the possibility to specify if an element
is a literal.
The \#:literals option specifies identifiers that should be treated as literals
rather than pattern variables.
This option helps to ensure that a refactoring operation made is targeted only
to the correct elements of the language.
Datum literals, represented by \#:datum-literals are a complementary keyword to the
literals.
Datum-literals match symbols instead of an identifier and can be rather useful as
the literals option because it provides a wider range of options.

However because of an unknown bug the literals option only works with the expanded-program %should I use this?
and we are limited to use the datum-literals option. This could possible create
incorrect refactoring transformations when the user renames the literals of the
language. e.g(renaming the if, cond, let, defines, syntax, when, unless, etc)

\subsection{Pretty Printing}

Pretty Printing (E.g. Cond lets etc)
The racket makes it easy to modify syntax using the syntax-parse to transform the
AST into another AST.
In order to produce indented code we choose to use a pretty-printer already
incorporated in the language.
However this pretty-printer does not follow the convention in the cond clauses
should be surrounded by [] parenthesis. This is not considered a problem because
Racket supports both representations.
One possible solution is to use a different pretty-printer in
order to keep the language convention.

%Some syntax elements (s-expressions) lose some information about parenthesis.
%For example it is a convention that cond clauses should be surrounded by [] parenthesis
%but the syntax element does not store that kind of information.
%There are several pretty-printers developed for Racket and even the Racket language
%has one incorporated.
%The one already incorporated does not use the [ ] parenthesis, however racket
%supports both representations.

\section{Tool Maintenance}
Developer Point of view
%%%% Nor for the paper tough %%%%
%%automatic might help save work when the user nows what exactly the tool will do.
This feature combined with the automatic suggesting are a huge help to do the
evaluation of this refactoring tool and to use in battery tests.
First the automated refactoring displays all the possible refactoring found thus making it easier
to detect the refactoring operations in projects.
It makes it easier to evaluate the need to do the refactoring and to evaluate
if the refactoring tool (frameowork) is working correctly.
Second the automatic refactoring makes it easier to test if the refactoring operations are correct (**** for a limited test cases ****)
This is possible by running the test cases of the program before any refactoring.
Then using automatic refactoring in the program that applies all the refactoring that the tool finds.
And finally by running again the test cases of the program.
After testing it with several (or huge) programs if every test passes (or the exact same tests, because refactoring operations should not fix bugs)
we can consider that the refactoring operations are correct.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:Related-Work}

\subsection{Scheme}
A refactoring tool \cite{griswold1991program} for scheme, implemented in Lisp that
uses two forms of information, AST and PDG (program dependence Graph).
The AST represents the abstract syntactic structure of the program.
While the PDG explicitly represents the key relationship of dependence between
operations in the program. %control flow!
The graph vertices's represent program operations and the edges represent the flow of
data and control between operations.
However the PDG only has information of dependencies of the program. And if there
are two semantically unrelated statements they could be placed arbitrarily with
respect to each other.
%Whitout the constraints given by the AST two semantically unrelated statements
%could be placed arbitrarily with respect to each other. %rewrite!
Using the AST as the main representation of the program ensures that statements
are not arbitrarily reorder.
And the PDG is only used as a notation to prove that transformations preserve
the meaning and as quick way to retrieve needed dependence information.
Contours are used with the PDG providing scope information, non existent in the PDG,
to help reason about transformations in the PDG.
%Rewrite, talk about the scopes
With these structures it is possible to have a single formalism to reason effectively
about flow dependencies and scope structure.
\subsection{Haskell}
HaRe \cite{thompson2005refactoring} is a refactoring tool for Haskell that
integrates with Emacs and Vim.
%(abstract syntax tree)
The HaRe system uses an AST of the program to be
refactored in order to reason about the transformations to do.
The system has also a token stream in order to preserve the comments and the
program layout by keeping information about the source code location and the comments of all tokens.
It retrieves scope information from the AST, that allows to have refactoring operations that
require binding information of variables. %so a def-use-relation?
The system also allows the users to design their own refactoring operations
using the HaRe API.
\subsection{Python}
  \subsubsection{Rope}
  Rope is a Python refactoring tool written in Python, which works like a Python library.
  In order to make it easier to create refactoring operations, Rope assumes that a
  Python program only has assignments and functions calls. %(can this be a bad thing?)
  Thus, by limitating the complexity of the languages reduces the complexity of the
  refactoring tool.
  %The tool can easily get information about the assignments.
  %However, for function calls it is necessary to have other approaches in order to
  %obtain the necessary information.
  Rope uses a Static Object Analysis, which analyses the modules or scope to get
  information about functions.
  Rope only analyses the scopes when they change and it only analyses the modules
  when asked by the user, because this approach is time consuming.

  The other approach is the Dynamic Object Analysis that requires running
  the program in order to work.
  The Dynamic Object Analysis gathers type information and parameters passed to and returned from
  functions in order to get all the information needed.
  It stores the information collected by the analysis in a database.
  If Rope needs the information and there is nothing on the database the Static
  object inference starts trying to infer the object information.
  This approach makes the program run much slower, thus it is only active when
  the user decides.%TODO improve
  Rope uses an AST in order to store the syntax information about the programs.

  \subsubsection{Bicycle Repair Man}
  Bicycle Repair Man
  Bicycle Repair Man is a Refactoring Tool for Python written in Python.
   This refactoring tool can be added to IDEs and editors, such as Emacs, Vi, Eclipse,
    and Sublime Text.
  Bicycle Repair Man is an attempt to create the refactoring browser functionality for
   Python and has the following refactoring operations:
   extract method, extract variable, inline variable, move to module, and rename.

  The tool has an AST to represent the program and a database that has information
  about several program entities and dependency information.
  \subsubsection{Pycharm-edu} %%%ADD references
  Pycharm Educational Edition\footnote{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/},
   or Pycharm edu, is a IDE for Python created by JetBrains,
  the creator of IntelliJ.
  The IDE was specially designed for the educational purpose, for programmers
  with little or no previous coding experience.
  Pycharm EDU is a simpler version of Pycharm community which is the free
  python IDE created by JetBrains.
  Therefore t is very similar to their normal IDEs it has interesting features
  as code completion, version control tools integration.
  However it has a simpler interface when compared with
  Pycharm Community and other IDEs such as Eclipse or Visual Studio. %good for beginners, explain

  It has integrated a python tutorial and the big advantage is the possibility of
  the teachers creating tasks/tutorials for the students.
  However the Refactoring Tool did not received the same care as the IDE itself.
  The refactoring operations are exactly the as the Pycharm community IDE wich were made
  for more advanced users.
  Therefore it does not provide specific refactoring operations to beginners.
\subsection{Javascript}
There are few refactoring tools for JavaScript but there is a framework
\cite{feldthaus2011tool} for refactoring JavaScript programs. %FIXME I do not like it
In order to guarantee the correctness of the refactoring operation, the framework
uses preconditions, expressed as query analyses provided by pointer analysis. %TODO explain better!
Queries to the pointer analysis produces over-approximations of sets in a safe way to
have correct refactoring operations.
For example, while doing a rename operation, it over-approximates the set of expressions
that must be modified when a property is renamed in a safe manner.
%FIXME explained enough?
%a set L of object labels over-approximates a set O of runtime objects if every
%object o ∈ O is represented by some l ∈ L.
To prove the concept, three refactoring operations were implemented, namely rename,
encapsulate property, and extract module.
By using over-approximations it is possible to be sure when a refactoring
operation is valid.
However, this approach has the disadvantage of not applying every possible refactoring operation,
because the refactoring operations for which the framework cannot guarantee behavior
preservation are prevented.%FIXME rewrite if possible
It was expectable that this framework would prevent a big percentage of refactoring
operations, but after testing with 50 JavaScript programs,
the overall unjustified rejections were 6.2\% of all the rejections.
The rejections regarding imprecise preconditions represent 8.2\%.
Finally, the unjustified rejections due to imprecise pointer analysis were of
5.9\% for the rename and 7.0\% for the encapsulate property.

%proved that meaning-preserving restructuring can substantively reduce the maintenance cost of a system. %How??

%syntax and was available an implementation in Common Lisp of a Scheme PDG (program dependence graph).
%The prototype had simple restructuring operations to prove the concept, such as:
% moving an expression, renaming a variable, abstracting an expression, extracting a
%  function, scope-wide function replacement, adding a reference indirection and adding looping to list references.
%%REWRITE THIS
%In order to be able to correctly implement these operations it was used contours and a PDG.
%contours?
%It uses Contours as the main program representation.
%Contours are an abstraction of the essential semantic properties that the AST
%represents in an efficient and complete form.
%And it uses the PDG to ensure [Insert Stuff Here]
%The PDG is used because simple graph algorithms can extract this information and
%it has been a popular program representation for aiding program parallelization,
%optimization and version merging.
%Unparsing a PDG is theory in NP, even tough in practice is not considered NP.

%Smalltalk Refactoring Browser %FIXME REWRITE AND CORRECT

The Refactoring Browser \cite{roberts1997refactoring} is a refactoring tool for
Smalltalk programs which goal was to make refactoring known and used by everyone.

To do that they implemented the refactoring browser with the concern that the
 refactoring operations did by the programmer using the refactoring browser needed to be faster than by hand.

It was considered that the user of this tool is intelligent therefore automated
refactorings would not suit them.
Automated refactorings do not suit the user because they could generate code that
 would not make sense in the domain.
For example, the tool would generate new classes in order to eliminate duplicated
code, by creating an abstract class, which might not make sense in the domain.
Instead of doing that, the tool points out possible refactoring operations and
lets the user decide whether or not to do those operations.

In order to ensure behavior preservation the tool checks the preconditions
of each refactoring operation before execution.
However, there are some conditions that are more difficult to determine statically,
 such as dynamic typing and relationships cardinality between objects.
Instead of checking the precondition statically the refactoring browser checks
the preconditions dynamically.

The preconditions checks are done using method wrappers to collect runtime information.
The Refactoring Browser starts by doing the refactoring operation and then it
adds a wrapper method to the original method.
While the program is running, the wrapper detects the source code that called
the original method and changes it for the new method.
For example, in the rename operation, after applying the rename and while the
program is running, whenever the old method is called, the browser suspends the
execution and changes the code that called the old method, so that it now calls the new method.
The problem of this approach is that the dynamically analysis is only as good
as the test suit used by the programmer.

\subsection{Python}

The following section presents two refactoring tools for Python.
It starts with Bicycle-Repair-Man\footnote{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bicyclerepair/0.7.1},
 a refactoring tool that attempts to create a refactoring browser.
Afterwards it presents Rope\footnote{https://github.com/python-rope/rope}, a
refactoring tool that works like a Python library.


Bicycle Repair Man
Bicycle Repair Man is a Refactoring Tool for Python written in Python.

  and Sublime Text.
Bicycle Repair Man is an attempt to create the refactoring browser functionality for
 Python and has the following refactoring operations:
 extract method, extract variable, inline variable, move to module, and rename.

The tool has an AST to represent the program and a database that has information
about several program entities and dependency information.
%Bicycle Repair Man does its own parsing so it replaces the Python's parser with
%its own wrapper to be easier to develop the refactoring operations.

%Rope


Rope is a Python refactoring tool written in Python, which works like a Python library.
In order to make it easier to create refactoring operations, Rope assumes that a
Python program only has assignments and functions calls. %(can this be a bad thing?)
The tool can easily get information about the assignments.
However, for function calls it is necessary to have other approaches in order to
obtain the necessary information.

Rope uses a Static Object Analysis, which analyses the modules or scope to get
information about functions.
Rope only analyses the scopes when they change and it only analyses the modules
when asked by the user, because this approach is time consuming.

%PyCore.run_module() runs a module and collects object information if perform_doa
%project config is set. Since as the program runs rope gathers type information,
%the program runs much slower. After the program is run, you can get better code
%assists and some of the refactorings perform much better.

The other approach is the Dynamic Object Analysis that requires running
the program in order to work.
The Dynamic Object Analysis gathers type information and parameters passed to and returned from
functions in order to get all the information needed.
It stores the information collected by the analysis in a database.
If Rope needs the information and there is nothing on the database the Static
object inference starts trying to infer the object information.
This approach makes the program run much slower, thus it is only active when
the user decides.

Rope uses an AST in order to store the syntax information about the programs.

While naively over or under approximating the set of expression that must be modified when a property f
is renamed would be unsound, we describe an algorithm that over approximates this set in a safe manner
(how?)

JAVASCRIPT
