\section{Evaluation} %FIXME improvee!!!
Case Study: (find a good ones) FP Project, Architecture Project. For SLATE
Correctness: Here?


This are some real examples of pieces of code made for beginners, in the course
project of the programming introductory course.


The examples show the usage of some of the refactoring operations previous presented
and here is explained the motivation for their existence.
This examples are appear repeatedly in almost every project. Thus supporting
the need to this kind of refactoring.


\section{Conclusion}


There are some conclusions one can make. Firstly it seams that a refactoring %FIXME
tool for functional refactoring operations in languages that are expression based
can be made only with information obtained from the AST and def-use-relation.
The second one is the crescent importance of the support given to beginner users %FIXME
that made JetBrains, a company known for their professional IDEs, to make PyCharm - edu
 an IDE that is aimed for beginners and it also has incorporated a refactoring tool.
 Lastly the refactoring tools concern with professionals leaves the beginner
 user helpless.
 A refactoring tool aimed for beginners would help them to safely improve %FIXME!!!!!
 their code while giving those users the first contact with a refactoring tool.


%def-use-relations + AST is sufficient.

\section{Future work}
There are some improvements that we consider important. For example it would
be a huge improvement to detect when a developer is refactoring in order to help the developer finish the
refactoring by doing it automatically.
This would be important specially for beginners that would help them finishing
the transformations safely while teaching them refactoring operations. %FIXME yup...
Automatic detecting of duplicated code is very naive.
Therefore improving the detection of duplicated to be smarter and understand if
two variables represent the same even if the names are different, or even if there
are some expressions in different places (commutative expressions). %FIXME !!!

Because the goal of the refactoring tool is to let beginners have the first touch
with refactoring tools, having a good preview is important to show the user what
the refactoring operation does.
Improving the existing preview and changing from the menu to the code directly
would be a great improvement to this refactoring tool.

%Improve the Preview of the refactoring operations.

%Improving automatic detection
In the same line of thought, having a better automatic detection would make the
life easier for the novice programmers. Having different colors for different
types of refactoring operations is a good way to show the users more information
and to let the user know what refactoring is being suggested without having to
select the area.
Another improvement that could be made is the color intensity of the suggestion.
With a lower intensity for low "priority" refactoring operations and a high intensity
for higher "priority". Thus giving the user a better knowledge of what is a better
way to solve a problem or what is a strongly recommendation to change the code.
