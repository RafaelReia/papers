\section{Evaluation}
Case Study: (find a good ones) FP Project, Architecture Project. For SLATE
Correctness: Here?


This are some real examples of pieces of code made for beginners, in the course
project of the programming introductory course.


The examples show the usage of some of the refactoring operations previous presented
and here is explained the motivation for their existence.
This examples are appear repeatedly in almost every project. Thus supporting
the need to this kind of refactoring.


\section{Conclusion}

There are some conclusions one can make. Firstly it seams that a refactoring
tool for functional refactoring operations in languages that are expression based
can be made only with information obtained from the AST and def-use-relation.
The second one is the crescent importance of the support given to beginner users
that made JetBrains, a company known for their professional IDEs, to make PyCharm - edu
 an IDE that is aimed for beginners and it also has incorporated a refactoring tool.
 Lastly the refactoring tools concern with professionals leaves the beginner
 user helpless.
 A refactoring tool aimed for beginners would help them to safely improve
 their code while giving those users the first contact with a refactoring tool.


def-use-relations + AST is sufficient.

Importance of some refactoring operations

Maintainability of the refactoring tool?

Framework?
\section{Future work}
Detect when a developer is refactoring in order to help the developer finish the
refactoring by doing it automatically.
Improving automatic detection
Wide-scope-replacement smarter and better, computation of the arguments
Improve the Preview of the refactoring operations.
