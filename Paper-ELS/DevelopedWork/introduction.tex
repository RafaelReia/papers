\section{Introduction}


Extension to Racket language that is good for learning and used in several
programming introductory courses around the world.
It has a pedagogical IDE tailor made for the Racket programing language, namely
the DrRacket, former DrScheme.
Whereas the Eclipse and Visual Sutio are the evil IDEs with such level of
complexity that is really hard for beginner students to understand.
Eclipse has around 300 menu options and Visual studio 280 with is a massive amount
of options for the user to select, DrRacket for example has around 100. (every option was acounted in the submenus
even options that are not available). regardless the number of options available,
the options in Eclipse or in Visual studio were in average more complex than the
options available in DrRacket.
Provide a refactoring tool intend for beginers, students that have one semester
of programing classes, that help correct typical errors made and suggest them
with possible refactorings.
The refactoring tool brings a new set of options that the student could use to
get used to the refactoring tool and provide a way to improve their code without
inserting errors in the code.


%DrRacket Pedagogical:
Catches typical syntactic mistakes of beginners and pipoints the exact source location
of run-time exceptions.
