%language support for beginners
%refactoring is an advantage
%there is a lot of tools that provide refactoring operations to
%languages that are "pedagogical"
%Existing tools are not made for beginners
%Racket is a pedagogical language
%DrRacket is a pedagogical environment
%Sweet COMBO
%we take on a pedagogical environment that SUPPORTS pedagogical languages
%and we made an AWESOME refactoring tool for beginners.

%the need to know how to program
The need to program is growing specially in areas non related with software engineering %computer engineering
have the need to know how to program and create simple programs.
It is growing so abruptly that it is appearing job proposals requiring a double degree in
architecture or design and in the computation field. %because that knowledge does not come with the first course.
This creates the need to have a better support to beginner programmers, we define
a beginner programmer as a user who had one semester of programming class. %TODO rewrite, weird step
Giving the users the tools and the means to create better software.
There are several languages that are known to be suited for the initial contact
with programming, such as Racket, Python and JavaScript which are used in introductory
courses around the world.

There are already refactoring tools available made for those languages, %%%%FIXME!!!HELPPP those languages, these languages, ????
however those refactoring tools were made for more advanced users and not for beginners.
Meaning that in general those refactoring tools do not have refactoring operations that %%TODO REWRITE this
would fit a beginner user.

Such refactoring tool need to improve code made by beginners, with refactorings for
the typical errors made, and be simple enough to be used by a beginner user.
%to detect code that might/should
Also, those tools do not provide any support in the detection of code which might/should
be refactored.
Automatic detection would help the users to know the refactoring operations available.
On top of that, the IDE in which most of those tools are embedded are too complex for beginners
to use, such as Eclipse, VisualStudio, Vim, Emacs. %carefull here!

Provide a refactoring tool aimed (made) for beginners, students that have one semester
of programing classes, that help correct typical errors made and make suggestions
to help those users with possible refactoring operations.
A refactoring tool brings a new set of options that the student could use to
get used to the refactoring tool and provide a way to improve their code without
inserting errors in the code.
%FIXME
Although there is DrRacket a pedagogical IDE, formerly known as DrScheme, that was
build for the Racket Language, it does not have Refactoring Operations.

Being an extension to Racket language that is used for teaching introductory courses,
and kown as a good language to learn how to program.
Besides that, it has a pedagogical IDE tailor made for the Racket programing language,
the DrRacket, former DrScheme. %TODO improve

%give moto
%create story, but how?
%add examples of typical errors


Whereas the Eclipse and Visual Sudio are the difficult IDEs for beginners with such level of
complexity that is really hard for a beginner student to understand.
To have an idea, Eclipse has around 300 menu bar options and Visual studio 280 with is a massive amount
of options for the user to select. On the other end, DrRacket has around 100. (every option was accounted in the sub-menus
even options that are not available). Regardless the number of options available,
the options in the menu bar in Eclipse or in Visual studio were in average more complex than the
options available in DrRacket.
%DrRacket Pedagogical:
%Catches typical syntactic mistakes of beginners and pinpoints the exact source location
%of run-time exceptions. %%more stuff??


%These languages already have refactoring tools available, however those refactoring tools
%are meant for advanced users only providing refactoring operations for more advanced
%users.
%to detect code that might/should
%And do not provide any support in the detection of code that might/should be refactored.
%On top of that, the IDE that those tools are inserted are too complex for beginners
%to use, such as Eclipse, VisualStudio, Vim, Emacs. %carefull here!

%Talk about Python, Javascript, Racket, lisp?
%There are already several refactoring tools mande for languages used in introductory courses
%or that are simple enough to be considered tailored for beginners (or pedagogical ones)
%However there are none made for beginners, meaning that do not have refactoring operations
%that would fit a beginner user, namely for improving syntax made by beginners, and
%simple enough to be used by a beginner user.
