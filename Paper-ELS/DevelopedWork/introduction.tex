\section{Introduction}
In order to become a proficient programmer, one needs not only to
master the syntax and semantics of a programming language, but also
the style rules adopted in that language and, more important, the
logical rules that allow him to write simple and understandable
programs.  Given that beginner programmers have insufficient knowledge
about these rules, it should not be surprising to verify that their
code reveals what more knowledgeable programmers call ``poor style,''
``bad smells,'' etc.  As time goes by, it is usually the case that the
beginner programmer will learn those rules and will start producing
correct code written in an adequate style.  However, that learning
process might take a considerable amount of time and, as a result,
considerable amounts of poorly-written code might be produced.  It is
then important to speed up this learning process by showing, from the
early learning phases, how a poorly-written fragment of code can be
improved.

After learning how to write code in a good style, programmers become
critics of their own former code and, whenever they have to work with
it, they tend to take advantage of the opportunity to restructure it
so that it becomes easier to understand and conforms to the style
rules.  However, in most cases, these modifications are done without
complete knowledge of the requirements and constraints that were
considered when the code was originally written and, as result, there
is a serious risk that the modifications might introduce bugs.  It is
thus important to help the programmer in this task so that he can be
confident that the code improvements he anticipate are effectively
applicable and will not change the meaning of the program.  This has
been the main goal of \emph{code refactoring}.

Code refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such
a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet
improves its internal structure \cite{fowler1999refactoring}.
Nowadays, any sophisticated IDE includes an assortment of refactoring
tools, e.g., for moving methods along a class hierarchy, to extract
interfaces from classes, and to transform anonymous classes into
nested classes.  It is important to note, however, that these IDEs
were designed for advanced programmers, and that the provided
refactorings require a level of code sophistication that is not
present in programs written by beginners.  This makes the refactoring
tools inaccessible to beginners.
%For instance, Eclipse\cite{carlson2005eclipse} has around 300 menu bar options and VisualStudio\cite{ford2011coding} 280, which is a massive amount
%of options for the user to select.

In this paper, we present a tool that was designed to address the
previous problems.  In particular, our tool (1) is usable from a
pedagogical IDE designed for beginners \cite{pears2007survey}\cite{kolling2003bluej}, (2) is capable of analyzing
the programmer's code and inform him of the presence of the typical
mistakes made by beginners, and finally (3) can apply refactoring
rules that restructure the program without changing its semantics.

We implemented our idea for a refactoring tool in DrRacket a pedagogical IDE \cite{drscheme}\cite{drscheme_pegadogy},
used in schools around the world which provides a simple and straightforward interface.
DrRacket is tailor made for the Racket programming language, that is well known for its
use in introductory programming courses, and currently has only one simple refactoring
operation which allows renaming a variable.
Our implementation significantly extends the set of refactoring operations available
in Drracket.
